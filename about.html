                    I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Northern Iowa, estimated to graduate in May of 2024. I pride myself on my abilities as an analytical problem solver
                    as well as a creative visionary. I enjoy exploring various programming languages and disciplines, however I'm
                    particularly fascinated by web development.

                    I'm a big music fan, and I'm happy to discuss it in any context! My preferences expand over many genres, but I'm especially partial to
                    guitar music as I've been learning the instrument for a few years! My favorite band at the moment is
                    The Cars, and my favorite album of all time is Holy Diver by Dio.

                <p>
                    Although I'm not great at it, chess is another thing that I enjoy. At the recommendation of a friend,
                    I recently started playing and it has quickly become my favorite passtime. I'm always trying to learn more about fundamentals and strategies, and I'm always up for a challenge!
