                    I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Northern Iowa, estimated to graduate in May of 2024.
                    I pride myself on my abilities as an analytical problem solver
                    as well as a creative visionary. I enjoy exploring various programming languages and disciplines,
                    however I'm
                    particularly fascinated by web development.

                    I'm a big music fan, and I'm happy to discuss it any time! I'm partial to guitar-centric music as
                    I've been learning
                    the instrument for a few years now. My guitar hero is Gary Moore, if you haven't heard that name
                    before
                    you should go give him a listen. Currently, my favorite band is The Cars and my favorite album is
                    Holy Diver by Dio.

                <p>
                    Although I'm not great, chess is another thing that I enjoy. At the recommendation of a friend,
                    I recently started playing and it has quickly become my favorite passtime. I'm always trying to
                    learn more about fundamentals and strategies, and I'm always up for a challenge!
